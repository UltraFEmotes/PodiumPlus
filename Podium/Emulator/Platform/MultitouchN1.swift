/// The touchscreen controller on SPI1 (device tree `multi-touch,n18`,
/// driven by AppleMultitouchN1SPI), modeled at its SPI protocol, with its
/// interrupt ("ATN") on GPIO pin 21 (active low), chip select on GPIO pin
/// 49 and reset on GPIO pin 20. openiBoot's `multitouch-z2.c` documents the protocol; the
/// kernel driver's own trace messages and checks fill in the N1 parts.
///
/// Each transaction is one chip-select frame, and replies are pipelined:
/// what the controller clocks out during a frame is what it loaded after
/// the previous one — its answer to it, or, when it has nothing to
/// answer, whatever it wants to say unprompted. The driver works with
/// that: it sends each query twice and reads the second reply.
///
/// It powers up in its bootloader ("HBPP"). The driver checks for it —
/// the reply's first two 16-bit words must be bootloader status codes —
/// then downloads the firmware from `N81.mtprops` as a stream of `30 01`
/// data packets, reads and writes a few registers (`1C 73` / `1E 33`),
/// calibrates (`1F 01`) and executes it (`1D 53`). Each command but the
/// last is answered by pulling ATN low; the driver then sends an ATN
/// acknowledgement (`1A A1`, or `1A A1 18 E1 …` for a register read)
/// and reads the status (`0x4BC1` OK, `0x4AD1` for register writes) or
/// the value from its reply.
///
/// Running firmware speaks the Zephyr2 command set: 16-byte packets with
/// a 16-bit little-endian byte sum over bytes 0...13 in bytes 14...15,
/// answered in kind —
///
/// - `E2` interface version (byte 2) and maximum packet size (3...4).
/// - `E3 id` a report's error flag (byte 2) and length (3...4).
/// - `E6 id s len` / `E7 id s len` read a report: stage `s` 0 asks, stage
///   1 collects `E6 id 0 data… sum` (padded to 16 bytes) or, for longer
///   reports, `E7 id 0 data… sum` sized to fit.
/// - `E4 id …` / `E5 id s len …` write a report; the driver then reads
///   the command status with a single `E1` packet, so the status (byte 8,
///   0 for success) is loaded as soon as the write lands.
/// - `EA`/`EB` read a frame: with byte 2 = 0 the driver collects the
///   frame's length (bytes 1...2), which must already be loaded — the
///   controller loads it when it pulls ATN low to announce the frame —
///   then with byte 2 = 1 it collects the frame: `EA 00 len len pad`
///   (the five bytes summing to 0 mod 256), the frame, and the frame's
///   16-bit byte sum.
///
